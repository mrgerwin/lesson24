Handing Errors using Try/Except

Use your own file from last time or the file attached to continue programming the cash register app.

Part 3
Last time we left off not knowing how to handle user generated issues in our app.  Now we are going to handle the errors and save the program from crashing because of it.

import the error widget from guizero

Add a try block when appending to the Products and Customers lists
The except condition should use the error widget to tell the user what is wrong and allow them to fix it.  The window should not close unless the try is successful.

Add a try block when purchasing a product.  Again give them an error widget explaining the issue.

Now that is good programming.  The only problem now is that the products and customers that we add do not persist between sessions running the app.  We will fix this next.

When was Try/Exception used in the app?

Why is it important to do this when programming?

Should we use a try block for every line in the program?  Why/Why Not?
